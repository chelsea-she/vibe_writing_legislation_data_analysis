FEC which debated whether corporations are to considered as groups, or as individuals. One of the arguments against considering corporations as individuals was that doing so would cover them under the same rights as individual persons. By doing so, it would open them up to rights such as freedom of speech which included campaign financing. Proponents against this argued that it would create an uneven playing field due to the wealth of resources, and thus influence, that corporations tend to have in comparison to individual people. In this sense, not everyone would be able to experience the true democracy.Others who argued for the unification of corporations as single entities argued that these new protections would boost innovation. Instead of being tightly regulated by the government and made to work in ways that might have fit the government's agenda, these corporations would be able to take their own steps forward and pursue their desired topics. In this sense, proponents argued that this allowed for their human stakeholders to exercise their own freedoms within their companies. These included having the freedom to fund the candidate that they desire to or express political opinions without fear of government retaliation. In the end of the this case, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of large corporations, thus granting them rights that have protected citizens for hundreds of years. Among other rights, corporations have been able to financially support presidential candidates and alter the outcomes of politics. Whether these actions have dramatically twisted the outcomes within politics is unknown, however, one thing remains certain, politics are no longer the same as they were before.Outside of politics, this ruling has paved the way for other changes within law such as in the case of Apple v. FBI in which Apple was sued for withholding information from the FBI in an investigation. This case was ultimately ruled in favor of Apple which allowed corporations to protect the privacy of their consumers free of possible government interference. With corporate personhood, corporations were able to lean on these rights to protect not only themselves, but also those under them ranging from the CEO to the consumers.Whether corporate personhood can be said to be more beneficial or harmful individual persons is hard to say and remains in a gray zone, however, this tension that exists corporate rights and individual rights does continue to shape our society in unexpected ways.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
