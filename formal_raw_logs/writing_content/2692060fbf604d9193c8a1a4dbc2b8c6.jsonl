These rights are often interpreted by the judicial system. However, you may be surprised to know that in the United States, Walmart may have similar rights and responsibilities.This is because of corporate personhood, or juridicial personality. In the United States, corporations have the ability to own property, sue people and other corporations, and enter contracts. Corporate personhood was established in 1886 during the supreme court case of Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad. Corporations were given even more rights in the 2017 supreme court case Citizens United vs FEC, where a majority conservative court argued that campaign spending was a type of free speech, granting corporations more protections regarding campaign donations. While many countries have some form of corporate personhood, including the United Kingdom and Canada, the United States is unique in the level of freedoms granted to corporations. The level of freedoms granted to corporations in the United States is dangerously high, because of the imbalance of power. While corporations might have similar legal rights as individuals, they often have huge amounts of capital. Many corporations have millions of dollars to spend on campaign donations and lawyers, when the majority of people do not. Because of this, allowing corporations more and more legal freedoms is giving them more power in a world where they already have the majority of power. In addition, corporations are often given more rights than individuals. While individuals have donation limits during political campaigns, corporations are allowed to spend significantly more. This can lead to political spaces being dominated by corporate interests. In addition, corporations can avoid personal liability, while individuals cannot. In addition, the barriers to creating a corporation are extremely high, requiring multiple forms. Because of the barriers of creating a corporation, there are high barriers to gaining the legal power and status of corporations. Because of this, a cycle is created where the richest citizens get a disproportionate amount of political and legal reach.It is often argued that corporate personhood stimulates the economy and increases job opportunity through increased protection allowing investment and expansion. For example, without the protections and stability that corporate personhood grants companies such as Amazon, would they have the resources to invest into communities such as in Virginia? While corporate personhood can protect companies allowing for economic benefits, the protection of companies also allows for the easier exploitation of people. For example, giving companies the ability to donate such large amounts can incentivize politicians to favor their corporate donors. This decreases competition, which is bad for consumers and the public.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
