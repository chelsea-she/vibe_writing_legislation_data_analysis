Zero price markets refer to any kind of good or service that can be used for free, such as social media apps like Facebook or Instagram, or booking services like Expedia. Such services primarily make their revenue through ads which are shown to customers throughout their interaction with the service. Antitrust law, which originally emerged in the late 1800s to fight against monopolies and promote fair competition, have struggled to properly adapt to the interesting challenge of zero price markets. 2 significant cases ongoing in America right now that relate to this is the Google antitrust case and the Facebook antitrust case. In both cases, prosecutors are claiming these free services hurt free competition and constrain consumer choice. Additionally, there is the fear that consumer data such as personal information and browsing habits are being sold to third parties, without the consent of the consumer. In response, Google and Facebook lawyers claim that their free services actually improve the welfare of consumers and advertisers by promoting innovation. Concerning data, Google and Facebook claim that while they do transfer data to advertisers, it is anonymous, and that they care about protecting user privacy. Europe is also going through a similar situation, however the EU has already enacted policies that constrict zero price markets. The Digital Services Act, passed in 2022, enforces transparency and seeks to protect user data, whereas the cases in America are still pending. The public largely is on the side of the prosecution in these arguments, at least as it pertains to their data. While the free digital experiences are certainly very useful, many are worried about their data being sold. In response to this, many people are quitting social media, or using alternative search engines other than Google. For instance, DuckDuckGo is a popular search engine that emphasizes that your search habits are not tracked. It will be interesting to see how these antitrust cases continue to develop over the next few years. Clearly, companies like Facebook and Google hold a lot of power, and their services provide a lot of utility to their customers, so it is hard to clearly see where the harm lies. But in a world where so much of a person's data is online, it would perhaps be prudent for American policymakers to consider other tech policies enacted around the world in order to create a much safer digital experience for its citizens.
