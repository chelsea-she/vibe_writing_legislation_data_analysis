FEC, where the Court ruled that money spent on political campaigns is a form of protected free speech under the First Amendment. This is because the Court ruled that corporations are entitled to the same rights as individuals: if individual human donors can donate with no limitations due to protections under free speech (or political speech), then corporations are entitled to these same rights and should not have limitations as well. Corporate personhood can lead to imbalances in political power, giving wealthy companies too much influence over democracy. Corporations have the unlimited ability to donate and influence elections, whereas individuals have less power because their wealth is typically limited and less than that of a corporation. While corporate personhood has controversial implications within the sphere of campaign finance, it has also been applied to other areas of corporations. For example, corporate personhood impacts business regulations, allowing companies to sue or be sued like individuals in courts. This can change the type of court cases that corporations are affected by. Typically, corporations are mostly affected by consumer protection cases (individual vs. corporation), but if corporate personhood allows for corporations to be sued as individual vs. individual, then it can fall into different legal categories, potentially shifting accountability and liability in ways that affect consumers and businesses alike. While corporate personhood had negative implications within campaign finance because it allowed corporations to have unlimited power and influence in elections, the application of corporate personhood to the types of lawsuits corporations can enter into is typically seen as a positive effect, because it provides consumers a way to hold corporations accountable in court, balancing the scales of justice.Corporate personhood lets companies own patents and trademarks, enhancing their legal protections and competitive edge. The Constitution defines intellectual property rights as something that only humans can hold, which used to limit businesses' abilities to hold copyrights and patents. However, because corporations are entitled to rights through corporate personhood, arguably, they are also entitled to Intellectual Property rights. This can be seen as a benefit because the intellectual property can stay with a company with an unlimited lifespan, rather than a person with a limited lifespan. For example, if Apple were to invent a new device, the patent would belong to Apple, rather than the inventor. Apple can then hold the patent for a longer period of time because the corporation will never \"die\". However, giving intellectual property rights to corporations can be controversial because it can hinder innovation by protecting corporate interests over individual creativity and smaller businesses\u2019 potential contributions.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
