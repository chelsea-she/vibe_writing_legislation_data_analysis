Consider social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram; with the engagement they have from average people, these platforms are prime examples of a zero-price market that consumers interact with on the daily. Other zero-price markets well known to the average consumer include travel booking sites and software companies. Travel sites like Kayak and software like Google Docs offer free services through ads, fitting the zero-price market model. Upon their initial popularization, zero-price markets were initially seen as innovative, bringing in a new wave of technologically driven business. However, as they have become more integrated into business, many are worried about hidden costs, privacy issues, and many other challenges they are associated with. Zero-price markets are not regulated by antitrust laws in the same way traditional business is. Antitrust laws prevent monopolies, ensuring fair competition and protecting consumer choices in the marketplace. A monopoly is when one company dominates a market, limiting competition and consumer choices. The monopoly sets the tone and pricing for business. Currently, the FTC, or the Federal Trade Commision is responsible for limiting companies from forming monopolies. Specific examples of the ways the FTC addresses monopolies are by denying and approving mergers of large companies, to ensure there is sufficient market competition. Under a traditionally capitalist system, they prevent greed for the sake of profit. Without the application of antitrust laws in zero-price markets, consumers are left without clear protection for their privacy and at the jurisdiction of the company's will. For example TikTok's data scandals showcase how unchecked platforms can exploit user information without accountability. Without a clear business transaction between consumer and business in a zero-price market, businesses seek alternative methods for profit, often at the expense of the consumer and without their knowledge. Some suggest incorporating transparency requirements for data usage in zero-price markets to safeguard consumer interests. Without the introduction of legislation calling on businesses to protect their consumers, privacy and trust will consistently be violated. To argue the lack of risk in zero-price markets, many with opposing view points claim that zero-price markets merely rely on alternate revenue streams, which are not as risky as traditional business ventures. An alternate revenue stream could be advertisement integrated into platforms. However, advertisements are successful as a stream of revenue when they are actually able to target an audience interested in their product. The way zero-price markets like social media target advertisements to make them appealing to specific users is by analyzing the individual consumer's data, and by selling it to third party companies without the knowledge of the consumer. This itself is a unique risk in this form of business, as traditional company customer interactions prior to the popularization of zero-price markets did not focus on uninformed consent from the customer. Therefore, these alternate streams of revenue are arguably more risky than traditional markets. ", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
