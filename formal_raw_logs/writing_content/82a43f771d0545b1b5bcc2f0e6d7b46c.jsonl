Generally, its aim is to protect competition, ensuring consumers have choices and fair prices. However, this may not apply to zero-price markets since the fact that free services are being offered may complicate dynamics between competition and consumer protection in that monetary value could be defined differently in these markets. For example, user data could be a form of important value for these company since their information could be used for other purposes, such as training large language models such as ChatGPT..and perhaps the ai used in this study..*cough Cough*. Anyhow, these changed dynamics where price may not be strictly defined may pose a challenge for typical antitrust laws for digital platforms for free service may not be   as free as it may sound. This raises questions about whether new laws are needed to address these unique market conditions.On one hand, since prices are not involved, it could be argued that conditions that could affect typical markets such as fair competition, mergers, and price fixing wouldn't affect markets where revenue may come from different sources apart from selling to a consumer. Since profit is not a core value in these markets, companies may be forced to innovate or compete with each other more since user attention and likability may be a large factor in the success of these companies. After all, many of these social media or digital platforms seemingly rely on what is trending or popular. They can both rise or fall due to the shifts in public opinion of their services. What they require is their users time and attention, not anything of monetary value. On the other hand, others could argue that what these zero-price platforms gain could be personal information or data, which when left unregulated could result in privacy violations from these services which could lead to bad faith in the usage of this collected data. This issue of balancing between the usefulness of user data and privacy violations may necesitate the enactment of update legislation for these zero-price markets, especially concerning digital platforms since the service-user dynamic is much different from that of traditional buy-seller markets. This evolving world of digital platforms may require regulators to rethink their laws limited both data useage and privacy, especially when free services are redefining the meaning of value.
