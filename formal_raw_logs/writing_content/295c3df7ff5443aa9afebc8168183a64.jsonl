This makes it tricky to determine fair business practices and consumer harm in these markets. Zero-price markets might harm consumers indirectly, so we need new rules to protect them effectively. The difficultly in regulating these markets is the current system of regulation prioritizes traditional pricing models, leaving gaps in how we address potential monopolistic behaviors. An example of this monopolistic behavior can be seen in the social media industry, where data privacy issues often arise without clear price tags on user consent. When Facebook acquired instagram it highlighted how market dominance can stifle innovation and limit choices for consumers in the long run. This impacts consumers and users by affecting their ability to freely choose alternatives that better protect their privacy and interests. This shows that although not paid through direct traditional means free services can still create dependency, making it hard for users to switch or demand better options. This is clearly a need for an alternative way to account for this level on monopolization. We should explore new criteria for assessing market power beyond just traditional pricing to ensure fair competition. If they want to remain consistent with the standards for using money are the measure tracking user data as a form of payment could help gauge value and protect consumer interests. Encouraging user cooperatives could empower consumers and create more competition in zero-price markets. There are solutions to how they could account for the impact without using money as the metric but if they would like to stay consistent with the scale they could account of other revenue streams from third parties as a way to see how the market is being impacted but these zero price markets. Regardless of the decided solution the legislators proceed with it is clear that these markets require a level of regulation similar to other markets. The idea that  consumer welfare is maintained through them not directly paying is disingenuous to the actual problem these markets face.  The alternative revenue streams that instead pay these companies do so for the purpose of getting the users data or selling them a product through advertising them things. So instead of the users paying for a product they are instead being sold as the product to other companies. This is not a reason to think that these zero-market companies then should be free of anti trust regulation but should instead get a similar or greater level of regulation to account for this. The market and the consumer would both benefit from creating new laws to account for these zero-cost markets that would otherwise be left unchecked by these laws.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
