However, the reality is that markets don't necessarily require priced transactions, but can actually exist through bartering and free exchanges (example being a zero-price market). Upon thinking about this concept though, I recognized that there is still something being taken from the consumer, specifically time/energy in consuming the product. This makes me wonder if the value of time can be considered a hidden cost in these exchanges. So, despite there not being any money involved in the transactions of a zero-price market, the cost of time could still be a concern that a zero-price market would need to consider. Clearly, the market still poses a threat to competitive markets because a zero-price market may easily monopolize the market especially for retired consumers/those who may not feel the need to rely on their own money. The reason for antitrust laws is to maintain fair competition. So, in maintaining restrictions on zero-price markets, all markets will have a chance to perform well. Furthermore, zero-price markets may not be up to par in the quality of the goods they exchange. Zero-price markets can lead to exploitation, as they often lack standards and regulation for consumer protection. For example, the way zero-price markets might advertise their goods could be in a way that works against their consumers. Take a game company who used ads to get revenue in a video game. Since the company wants money, they won't really care what ads they use and could harm young consumers by signing with a disgusting type of ad. Another example of the negative influence of an unregulated zero-price market is in the radio industry. In this situation, the radio industry was harming their consumers and only through merger reviews did these effects come to light. Therefore, it is clear that zero-price markets prioritize profit over user experiences, leading to decreased product satisfaction for consumers. Establishing antitrust laws may significantly reduce these side-effects and may bring to light those zero-price markets that rely on corrupted regulation. So, though zero-price markets may seem effectively different from other types of markets, they may still need significant regulations since antitrust laws don't only rely on money, but also involve significant market competition regulation and maintaining fair practices.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
