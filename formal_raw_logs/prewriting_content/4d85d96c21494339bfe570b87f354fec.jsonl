This would seem to mean that in zero-price markets, the antitrust laws would not apply. Although this is the tradition, antitrust laws might still pose a significant restriction to zero-price markets because zero-price markets rely on alternative revenue models such as advertising. This would mean that despite the fact they don't take revenue directly from consumers, there is still an intake and 'price' related to the market. Besides this, the term market, as used in zero-price market indicates that objects are being sold/given in a way that consumers would choose to use them - even if advertised for free. This would mean that there is technically a price involved in the market analysis and antitrust laws could apply to costs such as time being used in shopping/utilizing these goods and services. In my opinion, antitrust laws should definitely still apply to zero-price markets because these markets could be deadly for markets that do advertising along with pricing their items. If consumers become so reliant on zero-price markets for their goods, other markets may be under utilized yet overall quality of consumed goods may go down.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 1}
