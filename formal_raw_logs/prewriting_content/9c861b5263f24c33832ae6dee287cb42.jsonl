Through this background information, I learned that a zero price market is one where companies offer goods or services for free. While specific examples were not given, things like Instagram, Expedia, Booking.com, or Zoom seem to fit this description. As a consumer of these services, I realized that I have often taken the zero price factor of these things for granted. I find it to be very convenient and would be quite dissatisfied if I had to pay for these services every time I used them. But I had never really deeply considered the antitrust implications that zero price markets introduce. I am partially familiar with antitrust matters, but not too much. I have previously studied parts of antitrust history, such as events of the early 1900s where antitrust laws were instrumental into making a much more efficient market. However, I am less familiar with contemporary antitrust issues. Based on the background given here, as well as my own understanding, I believe that both perspectives on antitrust law as it applies to zero-price markets make sense to a degree, although I would be more inclined to believe that antitrust laws should adapt to address these markets effectively, rather than remaining static.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 1}
