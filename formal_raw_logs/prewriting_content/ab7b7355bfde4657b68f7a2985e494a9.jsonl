Seeing a corporation as its own legal entity changes the way the law impacts the managers and employees as opposed to the corporation itself. To me, this raises a few questions, such as, if the corporation is sued, who bites the bullet? That is to say, whose pocket does the money for this hypothetical lawsuit come out of. Is it a shared burden on all employees, managers, and owners? Do some take more of a hit than others? As a non-expert on this topic, those are the ideas that I believe are worth exploring in this realm of corporate personhood. With these immediate questions, I can understand why there has been political controversy with the concept as a whole.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 4}
