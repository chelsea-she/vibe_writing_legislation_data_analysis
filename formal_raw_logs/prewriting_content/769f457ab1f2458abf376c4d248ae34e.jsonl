For example, the local coffee shop in town can create its own contract and possess its own property and can, by law, proceed with any measures necessary by their standards if something violates their code of conduct or their written law. This means that every coffee shop might have different policies and procedures that customers need to follow. I think this is beneficial because it prevents the government or any large body of authority to have too much of a say on how small businesses and corporations decide to run. It reminds me of John Locke's saying of when the government takes its hand off of society. People who are opposed to corporate personhood usually do not support it because they perceive this as an opportunity for a business to become too strong and possibly corrupt.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 4}
