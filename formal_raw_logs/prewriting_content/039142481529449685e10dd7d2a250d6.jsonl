While zero-price markets are increasing in popularity both by consumers and producers, many can find it difficult to measure the success of each product when not using price. One example would the local Ithaca radio station, also known as WVBR. This group relies on many alternate revenue models, such as advertising small local businesses and using sponsors to host giveaways. While this profit model may seem quite alien compared to more traditional profit models of non zero-price markets, the end result is that local businesses in Ithaca have an easy and trusted way to promote themselves and any changes to their local community. As a whole, the small businesses of Ithaca have a sense of community with the consumers around them because they are connected through the WVBR station. Unfortunately, efforts to change revenue models for zero-price models can often harm these benefits for consumers. While rather unfortunate, it is very difficult to both keep consumer welfare and pricing and profit as priority. A great example of this would merger reviews with some larger radio stations that are often seen as higher value than those of smaller communities such as Ithaca. As zero-price markets continue to gain popularity and traction, how well they manage to adapt to these rising pressures will be key in both the happiness of the producers and consumers.
