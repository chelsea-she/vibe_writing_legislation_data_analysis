The difference between those companies that receive payment directly from the consumer and those recieving it from third parties relies on the consent of the individual users of the platform to be knowledgable on how the systems at play work to pay for the services. While anti trust laws typically use the traditional route of payment as a way to regulate the markets as that is seen as its impact it does not properly account for how these zero price markets work in the economy. These laws do not regulate the cost to the consumers through the means of these third parties due to this. This disparity leaves them unchecked in the market and can cause them to have rapid growth in number and overall power in the marketplace. Consider social media as a prime example as something typically free to use but paid through advertisements. When Facebook/Meta bought instagram it created a consolidation of the largest social media platforms without addressing the impacts on the market since they are both free to use. However both receive ads revenue in the billions which is not being considered. Since meta is acquiring such large shares of consumers focus and attention throughout the day the use of these advertisements and data can cause them to both sell them for larger amounts to their buyers as well as create more ads and incur larger costs to the consumer in that regard. If this was taken into consideration this may have been prevented and allowed for more competition in the market for ads and data protection that is otherwise being monopolized by the largest platforms. Social media is one example of this zero price markets but remains increasingly relevant to the economy and to consumers. This leads to the unfair outcomes that both stop new competition due to a barrier of entry but also unfair outcomes to the consumers as their choices are limited. This means that for the market to properly grow and account for fair competition that services that do not receive their revenue directly from the consumer should still be regulated in a similar vain to those who receive payment directly from them as they are impacted regardless in the marketplace.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 1}
