FEC (2010) when the Supreme Court ruled on the issue of whether corporations can be limited in the amount of money spent in campaigns. The problem came about when corporations were flagged for donating too much to campaigns, which can heavily influence the results of elections. Corporations typically have more money than individual people, which gives them extra influence in elections. I believe that in campaign finance law, individual human donors are able to donate with less limitations. \n\nOne of the legal questions in Citizens United v. FEC was whether corporations have the same rights as humans. According to the Constitution, humans are entitled to 1st Amendment rights of free speech, where the government cannot limit speech. Campaign donations have been seen as a form of expression and speech, which makes it difficult for the government to limit how much money individuals can donate. Therefore, the lawyers on behalf of Citizens United made the argument that corporations are groups of people, and corporations can stand for certain opinions, thoughts, and stances, which makes them entitled to First Amendment Free Speech protections. This has been coined to be the legal principlr of \"corporate personhood\". This then allows corporations to have less donations limits within campaign finance. \n\nThe implications of this Supreme Court case have extended beyond campaign finance. The principle of corporate personhood has been applied to issues such as intellectual property. The Constitution states that only people can hold intellectual property rights (patents, copyrights). But because corporations are entitled to corporate personhood, then arguably, corporations can hold intellectual property rights as well.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 4}
