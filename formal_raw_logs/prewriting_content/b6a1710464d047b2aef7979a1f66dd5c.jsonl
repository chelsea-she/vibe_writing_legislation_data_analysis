They have expanded into multiple new sectors, gaining popularity across several industries, including but not limited to software, media, and travel booking. This concept may seem like an entirely positive idea initially, but upon further analysis, are also associated with a number of challenges. To start, these markets do not maintain the same regulation as traditional markets because antitrust laws do not apply in the same way. There is no pricing to base the market analysis off of, therefore there are less protections for the consumers participating in these zero-price markets. A specific example the lack of antitrust laws in zero-price markets is with the radio industry. Consumers wishes were ignored for the sake of business. With the lack of zero-price markets in antitrust conversations, there must be a new way to protect consumers, or laws must be updated to best fit this new wave of business to make sure customers and consumers are being impacted favorably.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 1}
