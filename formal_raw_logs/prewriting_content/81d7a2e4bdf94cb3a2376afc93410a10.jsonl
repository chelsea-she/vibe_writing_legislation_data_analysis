This reminded me of something I learned a few months ago, which is that (if I remember correctly) over half of the biggest economies in the world are not countries but rather global companies. A large one that comes to mind is Amazon. It could be said that I should not have been astounded to learn this, as we all are aware of the fact that large corporations can and do have a major influence on societies and, even larger, governments themselves, but it really puts things into perspective. Being a college student who, similar to others, sometimes struggles to make ends meet, knowing that companies themselves can hold so much power over our societies and our living situations and the prices of our groceries is a bit sad. I do understand, however, that there are benefits to corporate personhood. For example, last summer I worked at a gas station that treated its employees quite well. The more hours you work there, the greater stock you are given in the company. Similarly, our Christmas bonuses were indicative not only of the hours that we worked but the net expansion of the company itself. Allowing employees to share in the wealth of the company created a better atmosphere within the workplace, and I think corporate personhood may make it easier to hold companies responsible for their wrongdoings, as well. On the other hand, it could be that corporate personhood may allow crooked businessmen to hide behind their businesses - if the company gets sued, for example, the owner does not receive the punishment. Instead, the company may see its demise, while the businessowner may go to open another shady business. Because I am someone who immerses herself in science, I cannot say that I have the most informed outlook on this particular topic. As such, the knowledge that I do have comes from my own (albeit limited) experience working at companies. Throughout my teenage years, I have worked at 3 different places as summer jobs - TJ Maxx, a winery/restaurant, and a gas station. All in all, I had positive experiences, but it is shocking to see how different government regulation is in a company like TJ Maxx in comparison to a restaurant. While I was guaranteed breaks at TJ Maxx every few hours, I was rarely allowed to even eat lunch at the winery, where I sometimes worked lunch, dinner, and a wedding reception all in one night (but I couldn't complain too much, as I received tips at the restaurant and not at TJ Maxx). As far as I'm concerned, the government does its best to regulate businesses and keep workers happy, but it is truly all about money and capitalism and the protection of businessowners, and the government is made up of lots of businessowners that are all looking to protect their own interests. To speak on the issue of the influence of corporations into politics, one must take into account the fact that, although it may be beneficial to treat the corporation in the courtroom like an individual, a company cannot cast a vote in an election. In my opinion, companies have no business becoming involved in political affairs, as the company itself is not a person. I think in recent elections it's been clear that due to the power of corporations in elections, politics is boiled down to having the most money. As someone born in Vermont who is a longtime fan of Bernie Sanders, it struck a chord with me when he talked about how he was one of the only people to win an election without the backing of a company. It's sad that politicians rely on money, especially as most of America is not in the position to be donating their hard-earned income to rich men who are looking to lead them to higher grocery prices. Consequently, it becomes the business of the corporation to donate money to these politicians, effectively rigging an election. This reminds me of another fact I learned recently, that although the lowest bidding electrical engineering contractor should have, in theory, won the right to do all the wiring in the new Buffalo Bills stadium, the bid ultimately went to a firm with significantly higher prices (by millions of dollars) simply because this firm was a past campaign donor of Kathy Hochul. Most people probably don't know (and frankly don't care) about something as minute as this, but I think this is simply a glimpse into what real politics is like. As simple civilians, we rarely get to see what goes on behind closed doors, and when we do, it can be a shocking experience.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED", "randomNumber": 4}
