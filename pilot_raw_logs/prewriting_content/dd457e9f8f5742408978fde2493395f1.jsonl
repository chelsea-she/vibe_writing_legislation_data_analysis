As an art historian and somebody exploring the social sciences, my answer to this question has always been that these two things cannot be separated, as the work is inherently tied to the social and political contexts of the maker and their environment. So translating that into corporate personhood, effectively separating the work and the company from the stakeholders at top ignores the political and social implications of each part. This would then allow an individual to hold morally corrupt ideas or to disseminate incorrect information while their corporation does not face the consequences. However, if the corporation itself, as a systematic/structural entity, were to make a mistake(pick the wrong stock to invest in, create an insensitive marketing campaign), while societally, even though those in power will face societal backlash, any and or all legal consequences will fall solely on the company. This then will force employees, those who aren't the face of the corporation, to feel the weight of the system's mistakes(through lay-offs, salary cuts, etc.). \n\tMy main position stands on the fact that proponents argue that what is beneficial about corporate personhood is its humane protection of the owners and the shareholders. While these individuals do deserve protection, such as every individual under American law, I believe that this policy heavily favors the protection of the owners over the employees. This allows the owners to then exercise greater power rather than restraint, allowing them to sway policial opinion and the corporation's stance in systematic debates. With this policy, I fear that we will see a mirroring of the gilded age robber barrons, who will have a monoploy over their industry and the industry's voice in the rest of the world in expense for the constituional rights of the humane workers and developers.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED"}
