The transactions which we partake in today no longer necessarily use the customer's literal capital as part of the transaction\u2014rather, in an \"attention economy\" like the one we have today, we often are more primed to desire the opinions and attention of others, which is often just as valuable.\nConsider the very public Cambridge Analytica scandal around the mid-2010s after Facebook was found to have been tracking and collecting user data for years, the behemoth now in possession of what are termed \"black-box models\" of user behavior. The idea of attention and information, both forms of valuable user data, being more important than just competing for a share of consumer wallets, is especially prominent in an AI-first era.\nIt's especially important because consumers have largely had the ability to intentionally choose where funds go\u2014with a limited budget, consumers are much more in control over their purchasing decisions as opposed to the involuntary action of paying attention to something.\nHowever, the alternative revenue models presented by zero-price markets are just as harmful. Advertising is only one dangerous application of our present information/attention economy. Other, more overtly insidious applications are government and corporate surveillance, political manipulation, and the spread of misinformation.\nOn top of this, the centralization of power within tech conglomerates, whom have both created this attention economy and have also been technically capable of closing off their methods and data extracted, presents a much larger challenge. Since the Gilded Age of  America (or maybe the era of Genghis Khan), we have never seen a society so fundamentally reliant on such a small group of CEOs which direct the attention of swathes of users\u2014like crossing guards herding children, or perhaps wolves herding sheep.\n\nOverall, I believe that antitrust law must grow to address a growing problem of how to stop this consolidation; Congress and other policymakers may simply not have the technical background to grasp the scale at which these companies have developed tools to monitor their very own constituents. We have increasingly subsumed ourselves into this culture of request and instant response: driven by algorithms, we are now able to receive the recommendations for goods and services that we may have never thought we wanted prior.\n\nThe call to action I present is to launch deep investigative audits into these companies\u2014zero-price markets may not aim to predate upon consumer capital, but they still at heart have the exact same characteristics as any other company: growth, product market fit, and attention. There is no reason why antitrust laws should not apply to companies in this domain.\n\nPrices are not the only metric that is needed to assess markets. I'm ngl though, I don't know much about this economics stuff so i don't really know what the alternative is.\n\neither way let's chill with the monopolies", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED"}
