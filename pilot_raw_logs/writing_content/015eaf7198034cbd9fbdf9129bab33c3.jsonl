Therefore, regulators must recognize that the dominance of these platforms often leads to an erosion of consumer autonomy and choice, as algorithms dictate what content we see and influence our decisions without us being consciously aware.Additionally, zero-price markets often operate under a guise of accessibility and personalization, while in reality perpetuating digital divides as they collect data from users who may not fully understand the trade-offs involved.  Consider ads one would generally see on an Instagram feed\u2014undoubtedly, you've noticed that they're tailored to your interests and past interactions, subtly nudging you towards making purchases or engaging with content that benefits the platform's advertisers more than your own needs. These ads, whether engineered to or not, steer user behavior, not meet them where they are. Monitoring user behavior has led to the usage of data as a commodity in larger political and economic transactions, many of which consumers are unaware and unable to opt out of. Recent scandals which have indicted large tech companies like Facebook (now Meta) as merchants of the data used.These issues of privacy and security are increasingly salient as AI models are improving at conferring user preferences from the increasing interactions we have online. Every year, the amount of time that people spend interacting with digital devices and the internet increases, disempowering users through mandating digital presence. Even the most basic tasks today\u2014filling out taxes or making doctors' appointments\u2014necessitate the usage of a computer, which places further reliance on middlemen providers such as Google or Cloudflare which are intercepting and monitoring this web traffic.After introducing the harms which this unregulated \"attention economy\" presents, how does this relate to zero-price markets? Most naturally, notice the significant shift from traditional models of financial transactions which involve exchanging some fixed amount of physical capital for a good or service. This transaction model has changed\u2014no longer are consumers actively choosing exactly what to trade. In using any free product\u2014particularly digital ones like apps or websites\u2014consumers are transmitting information to all digital intermediaries about their browsing habits.The involuntary nature of this exchange (attention instead of money) has crept up on consumers, veiled thinly by the offer of \"free\" services. In reality, consumers are forfeiting their power to choose in a market increasingly saturated with enticingly \"free\" options.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
