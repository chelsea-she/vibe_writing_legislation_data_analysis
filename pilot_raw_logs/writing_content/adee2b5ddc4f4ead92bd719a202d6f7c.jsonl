This means that companies may prioritize profit over user welfare, leading to exploitative practices. This is already happening with companies, including Meta and Apple. Consumers' data and information are being used for free as they conduct searches and potentially release private information online to AI as well as on social media. People have less privacy and are public about their lives, even online. This creates a dangerous cycle where companies can prioritize collecting data without considering the long-term implications for users, potentially leading to harmful consequences in areas like identity theft or misinformation. When people subject themselves to having this data collected, they are still able to use the tool for free, but at a great cost. Once people put their information online, it can stay online forever and cannot be taken back. Free products and services like Instagram and Facebook allow the user to stay active onine for as long as they would like, becoming the product. This whole time that the consumer is using social media, they are communicating their patterns and how their brain works, unknowingly giving companies access to their thinking and data. This creates a troubling dynamic where users may unknowingly sacrifice their privacy for convenience, illustrating the need for stricter regulations to safeguard personal data from exploitation in these zero-price markets. Meta has been known for leading consumers down wormholes and polarizing individuals. People see a post that is polarizing, and then are shown increasingly polarizing videos, desensitizing them and changing their opinion subconsciously. This reliance on algorithms to curate content can lead to echo chambers, further amplifying biases and misinformation, which negatively impacts societal discourse and understanding. Enhanced regulation could help mitigate these risks by enforcing transparency in how companies use and manage consumer data. Companies are concerned with making money and figuring out how to make their products more addictive. This persistent focus on profit over user welfare not only risks individual privacy but also endangers the overall fabric of society, as misinformation can sow discord and divide communities.Many products that are for free actually have paid versions that users are frequently prompted to use and occasionally swindled into buying, like premium versions of Snapchat, Chat GPT, or paying to boost posts on social media. To start addressing this issue, Antitrust laws surrounding unpaid services need modification, not only for consumer protection but also for fostering a fairer competitive landscape where businesses cannot thrive solely on exploitative practices aimed at maximizing profit, ultimately benefiting both consumers and the marketplace as a whole.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
