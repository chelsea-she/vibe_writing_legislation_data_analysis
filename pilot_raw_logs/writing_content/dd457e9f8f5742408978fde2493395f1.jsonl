This, in turn, allows employees to face the brunt of the consequences for the corporation's wrong-doings and permits owners to separate themselves from the wrongdoings of their corporations. The implications of corporate personhood suggest that corporations can overlook ethical and social concerns in favor of increasing profit. This profit would then circulate back to the owners and the stakeholders, allowing them to continue the cycle of un-ethical and profit centered decision making. Going back to consequences, when the corporation is then faced with legal charges, owners and stakeholders do not need to be held legally accountable, as they are separated from their work: their personhood is not legally interwoven with their corporate and professional decisions. However, someone like me, a mere employee, will most likely loose my job and must fight to the bone with my peers to secure another position(which is unlikely if the corporation were to have come under scandal) or have my salary significantly cut. So while an owner and shareholder can distance themselves from their professional decisions, those same decisions strictly determine an employee's position in the workforceEvery individual deserves legal protection -- that is not a question. But separating a corporation from those who shape them automatically contradicts our values of equality. Proponents often blame limited regulation for the type of disapproval I have held above. But central to my argument is that corporate personhood allows for limited regulation. Corporate personhood overextends our current constitutional powers to apply to an abstract entity, blurring the lines between legal protection of individuals and legal protection of money and other financial assets. So in a political environment full of strife(issues with immigration and abortion), corporate personhood proposes a dangerous imbalance where corporate interests outweigh human ones. And in a world where corporations are given the same personhood as literal people, the people who need the most help and are fighting for basic access to food, water, and shelter, will be overlooked time and time again. In conclusion, corporate personhood truly says that the government only cares to protect the constituional rights of those with money and status(i.e. owners and stakeholders), effectively labeling employees as second-class citizens and lower priority. Put differently, in a country that prides itself on providing every American citizen with their basic constitutional rights, ironically, only supports money and those with lots of it.
