I believe it is an illogical fallacy to claim that corporations are separate entities from their employees, customers, etc -- they are intensely correlated, and the larger body of the corporation cannot exist without and is wholly directed by the people contained within the company. I don't believe companies can have a collective voice or free speech that exists separately from the human for this reason -- it's like saying that the body is different from the brain and the body has separate rights from the brain. I believe that one is contained within and fully directs the other, and the concept of corporate personhood has always eluded me. I guess I see it as a method concocted by people who support companies' rights to do whatever they want and conservatives; perhaps I'm missing something but it always just seemed kinda stupid to me.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED"}
