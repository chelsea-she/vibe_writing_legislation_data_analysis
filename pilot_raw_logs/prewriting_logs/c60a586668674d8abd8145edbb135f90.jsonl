Once granted this status, the firm can own property, sign contracts, borrow money, be sued, and outlive its founders. That separation shields shareholders from personal liabilities. If the company fails, their losses are limited to what they invested, not their private assets. This feature has encouraged the large-scale, long-term projects characteristic of modern capitalism.\n\nI have ambivalent feelings about corporate personhood. On the one hand, the fiction is an undeniably clever piece of legal engineering. Juridical personality feels like a collective risk-sharing technology. However, a corporation has no conscience, no fear of exile, no intermate stake in the long-term health of the society. In many jurisdictions, it now speaks in elections, lobbies with rich funding, and leverages constitutional rights that were written for citizens.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED"}
