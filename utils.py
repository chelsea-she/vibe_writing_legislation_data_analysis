    """Zero-price markets," where companies offer goods or services for free, have rapidly 
  increased in number and variety, including areas like software, social media, and travel booking. 
  However, antitrust regulators have struggled to address these markets because traditional antitrust 
  laws are based on the idea that prices are essential for market analysis. This focus on pricing has 
  led to significant consumer harm being overlooked, as seen in the deregulation of the radio industry, 
  where potential negative impacts on listeners were ignored during merger reviews. 
  Some legal philosophies argue that zero-price markets should still be considered in antitrust discussions, as they can involve costs 
  that signal market behavior. Ignoring these markets could lead to unfair and inefficient outcomes, 
  so antitrust laws should adapt to address them effectively. Others argue that since zero-price 
  markets often rely on alternative revenue models, such as advertising, they do not pose the same risks as 
  traditional markets, suggesting that consumer welfare is maintained through these different mechanisms.""",
    """Corporate personhood, also known as juridical personality, is the legal concept that allows corporations to
  be treated as legal entities separate from their owners, managers, and employees. This means that corporations, like

  In Citizens United v. FEC, the Court majority interpreted campaign spending as an exercise of free speech, more specifically 
  political speech, and granted corporations protection from government restrictions on campaign spending. Critics have blamed 
  corporate personhood for expanding corporate rights and political influence, particularly in campaign financing. However, 
  proponents argue that courts generally extend rights to corporations not to benefit them as entities, but to protect the 
  constitutional rights of their human stakeholdersâ€”such as owners and shareholders. Instead of blaming corporate personhood, 
  proponents believe corporate empowerment might stem more from economic factors such as limited regulation, corporate longevity, and globalization.""",
