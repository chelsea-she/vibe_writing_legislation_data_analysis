This ends up giving companies a lot more leverage, power, and control in America's society and economy than many other countries, and also results in the saying that many companies are \"more than the sum of its parts\", referring to the idea that the company as a whole represents its own entity that resembles a person, completely independent and separate from the constituent stakeholders, managers, and employees. Corporate personhood is a major reason why companies have so much power over society and the economy in modern America, and has been blamed as one of the major reasons for why there is an increasing amount of income inequality in the country. Corporate personhood also results in the privatization of many formerly considered communal assets, including real estate and land. For example, recently many bills have been passed that now allow lands in the Southern U.S. to be bought and sold, and while many would expect wealthy individuals to purchase such land, corporate personhood results in most of the land being bought and privatized by large corporations, as these corporations are often much more well funded than any one individual. As a result, many natural areas in the United States are becoming private property, and a lot of citizens are upset about the increasing amount of restrictions on their \"right to roam\" and explore the nature around them. \n\nI'm unsure about whether or not corporate personhood exists in other countries, such as England, France, or China. \n\nCorporate personhood also results in a lot of companies in the U.S. being considered traditionally \"greedy\", or \"selfish\", but this is simply a consequence of these companies having the same powers and rights as an individual being. Corporate personhood is a prime example of how modern American policies tend to heavily favor corporations over the individual, treating them just like a living, breathing human in terms of rights while also acknowledging their immense advantage in terms of assets owned and money managed. This is likely due to the increasing amount of corruption in the U.S. government, with large corporations lobbying or bribing government officials to ensure that the legislation passed tends to favor large corporations. U.S. government officials also receive a lot of benefits by giving in to these bribes and listening to corporations, as they can gain an informational advantage about the companies' stocks and perform insider trading, further boosting their monetary revenue from such activities. These officials have no incentive, game theoretically, to deviate from their current strategy of accepting bribes, giving in to lobbying, and further supporting large corporations and giving them immense advantages such as corporate personhood. The average senator's base pay is often not enough to compensate for the magnitude of their job in terms of its impact on the entire country. In other words, the current system of U.S. government and its relationship with large corporations is not set up in such a way that allows each participant, or \"player\", to have the right incentive structure to reach a result that maximizes, or nearly maximizes, the benefit of the whole country. In game theoretic terms, the current system does not have a properly set up incentive structure and the resulting nash equilibrium has a high price of anarchy. This is all related to how corporate personhood may have originated or been passed by the U.S. government.", "event": "NEXT_CLICKED"}
