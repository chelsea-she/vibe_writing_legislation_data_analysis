Most familiarly, such regulations oppose the formation of monopolies that would force a consumer to go to a single supplier if they desire a specific product. If this were the case, said supplier could arbitrarily set prices without regard for being undercut by competition, as competition does not exist. Thus, antitrust laws allows for somewhat freer markets to operate on the economic philosophy that they consumer choice combats exploitation because the consumer would not willingly choose to be exploited. However, what about markets where goods do not have a price at all? In today's world, such zero-price markets are becoming ubiquitous online. Search engines, web browsers, and video streaming services are all digital products that usually do not come with a price. Yet, these markets cannot be ignored by antitrust regulations, as they still provide essential products that would suffer greatly from malicious suppliers.The importance of zero-price markets to daily life is a critical factor to consider when including them in antitrust discussions. It would be absurd to force almost any American to live their lives without the internet, and a massive amount of internet traffic is directed through search engines. This has caused the search engine Google to come under scrutiny, as it has become the go-to search engine for nearly all internet users \u2014 so much so that \"Googling\" has become its own verb. This gives a lot of power to Google in deciding what sites internet users visit. Too much power, perhaps. The lengths Google goes to to maintain this power is quite questionable. The most glaring example isn't with their search engine at all, but with another of their major products: the Google Chrome web browser. Google Chrome is by far the web browser with the largest market share. Just as with the Google Search, Google Chrome does not charge its users. However, unlike Google Search, Chrome does have a few nontrivial competitors. One competitor is the Mozilla Corporation's Firefox browser. Unfortunately, because web browsers are a zero-price market, the Mozilla Corporation has had some trouble in staying afloat. A major source of their revenue actually comes from payment by Google so that Google Search is used as its default search engine. In a way, Google is almost subsidizing the Mozilla corporation so that their own browser, Chrome, is not considered a monopoly. Google's hold over the search engine and web browser market is indeed a focus of internet antitrust, and these markets clearly cannot be ignored just because they do not directly take money from the consumer.How certain is it, though, that this harms the consumer, since they aren't paying anything? Take yet another one of Google's products: YouTube. As is becoming a common theme, YouTube is the go-to site for long-form video hosting. Video hosting services are prohibitively expensive to provide, so Google's willingness to use YouTube as a loss leader has forced other video sites to all but go extinct (until the advent of short-form videos). Unfortunately, this monopoly has not been addressed and YouTube is often cited as a website that has significantly degraded in quality due to the increasing overbearingness of ads. Yet, content creators or even those wishing to share long-form videos with friends have no suitable alternative to turn towards, so suffer through YouTube's relentless 30-second unskippable ads they must. If antitrust discussions continue to ignore this market just because YouTube is free, sharing long-form video content online will continue to become unbearable.Ultimately, to ignore zero-price markets in antitrust discussions is to overlook the complexities of consumer rights and market dynamics. As digital services continue to dominate daily life, understanding how power dynamics operate in these spaces becomes essential for ensuring fair treatment and genuine competition.", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
