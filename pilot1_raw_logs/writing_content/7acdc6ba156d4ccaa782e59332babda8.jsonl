This aligns with my previous thoughts about how the current government system is set up in a way such that the incentive structures of each government official (senator, house representative, etc.) is going to result in an outcome that is suboptimal for the country as a whole. This is because their optimal decisions will involve their own personal profit from bribes and lobbying, and they will make decisions favoring corporations and maximizing the corporations' profits as well. This in turn raises social inequality in the U.S. This cycle of profit-driven decision-making not only harms community welfare but also erodes trust in government institutions, leading to greater public frustration and disillusionment with the democratic process. This can cause a lot of citizens to question the effectiveness of their current government, and even with democracy in general. As a result, in more recent times, there have been a lot of protests that involve the desire to transform the government into something more socialist or more welfare oriented. Many online citizens have also tried to compare the U.S. government and its efficiency with other countries' governments, including Canada, England, France, and China. With the price of living increasing at a much faster pace than the median household income, Americans have begun comparing their quality of life to residents of other countries and questioning if their own government is still leading the \"most well off country in the world\". This comparison often highlights how other countries prioritize social safety nets and public services, prompting Americans to rethink their own values and expectations from government. A common example of a safety net / public service that America doesn't provide for its citizens is free healthcare, which is present in many foreign countries. Not only is healthcare not free, but it is often very expensive, especially for the average citizen, and many medications for diseases such as diabetes are often marked up ridiculous amounts in order to maximize company profits. Economically, these healthcare corporations are able to do so because of how much control they have over the market and with medication patents, that they can effectively renew indefinitely with legal loopholes. The fact that these healthcare giants also have the same rights as individuals makes it difficult for regular citizens to easily challenge or change the system that primarily serves corporate interests rather than their own. This is also related to the assassination of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson by Luigi Mangione, which was an event of public interest very recently. This growing discontent could lead to shifts in voter behavior, as citizens may seek representatives who genuinely prioritize public welfare over corporate profits, potentially reshaping the political landscape and pushing for reforms that align more closely with democratic ideals. Another example of this is the recent NYC mayoral primary election, where the previous mayor Andrew Cuomo competed against the more progressive and radical candidate Zohran Mamdani. Cuomo had been widely known to the public to be a figurehead for large corporations, frequently making policies that maximized corporate profits while leaving NYC residents in increasingly economically challenging situations. In a surprising upset, Mamdani ended up defeating Cuomo in the primary election. Mamdani, in his campaign, had frequently marketed himself as an up and coming politician with no strings tying him to large corporations or other government officials. He claimed that he answered to no one but himself and he was a strong advocate for the people, promising to address issues like healthcare and housing that had been largely ignored. This unexpected victory not only reflects a shift in voter sentiment but also demonstrates a growing hunger for accountability and change in a system perceived as catering too heavily to corporations.
