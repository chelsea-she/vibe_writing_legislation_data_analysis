Unfortunately, antitrust regulators focus on surface level aspects, driven by their belief that zero-price markets are inherently free and thus, its outcomes negligible. What they fail to see are the implicit costs associated with said market; while the products themselves may be free, there are plenty of ways that side-effects may give rise to capital gains. This lack of recognition can lead to a distorted understanding of competition, where companies prioritize data collection and user engagement over traditional metrics like pricing, ultimately shaping market behavior in ways that may undermine consumer privacy or reduce overall market fairness.A simple case study, Google, motivates this further. While the Google search engine is offered as a free service, the revenue generated from advertising and the extensive data collected from users creates a significant profit for Google, overlooked in most cases by a \"zero-price\" perspective. The example also hints at unexpected powers of zero-price markets: their ease of accessibility, which can ultimately give rise to monopolistic practices hidden behind the fa\u00e7ade of free services. Regulators must acknowledge that \"free\" goods or services may also pose risks to consumer welfare, as users might experience a loss of autonomy over personal data and face targeted advertising that reinforces biases, ultimately leading to a skewed marketplace driven more by manipulation than by genuine consumer choice. Failing to address this perspective can lead to catastrophic losses from negligent practices.Another issue that regulators fail to recognize is the potential impact of network effects in zero-price markets. As more users engage with a platform, it becomes increasingly valuable, creating a feedback loop that can stifle competition and reinforce monopolistic behaviors, ultimately making it harder for new entrants to gain traction. Although this may not classify as \"monopolization\", the self-contained nature of such loops can lead to market stagnation, hindering innovation and consumer choice as established players become even more entrenched in their dominant positions. The outcome is a market that is unfair and beneficial to none. As consumers are unconsciously brainwashed into habits and ways of thinking that can ultimately lead to harm, antitrust regulators abandon them for the sake of a more \"efficient\", or, frankly, \"easy\" solution.For a fair market that is beneficial to all, the approach to regulating these markets must evolve. By employing more nuanced metrics that account for both economic and social implications, regulators can create frameworks that promote healthier competition and safeguard consumer interests in a rapidly changing digital landscape. This evolution isn't something to be avoided for the sake of convenience; it is an inevitable step forward in the race to adjust to the modern world. ", "event": "DONE_CLICKED"}
